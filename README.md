# Simple Counter Web App

Welcome to the Simple Counter Web App project! This is a basic web application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Required Prerequisite

1. Begin by installing the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey for Visual Studio Code. This extension enables you to easily run HTML files in your browser.

2. Open Visual Studio Code, and on the left-hand side, click on the "Extensions" icon.

3. In the search bar, type "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey and select the extension from the results. Install it.

4. Once the extension is installed, open the HTML file that you've cloned or created. You'll notice a new option at the bottom of your window labeled "Go Live".

5. Click on "Go Live". This will automatically serve your HTML file on a localhost server.

## Contributing (What you need to do)

If you've followed the previous steps correctly, you should see a webpage displaying two buttons: "+" and "-", along with the number "0". This constitutes a basic counter application. However, at this point, the buttons do not function as intended.

Here's how you can proceed:

1. Begin by modifying the code in the index.js file to ensure the counter buttons work as expected.

2. Once you've completed the above task, verify that the count functionality is now operational. Clicking "+" should increment the count, while clicking "-" should decrement it.

3. For the next task, implement a feature to prevent the count from going below zero.

Note: It's recommended to attempt these tasks independently. If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to utilize resources like Google or ChatGPT. This is a common practice among developers; they often spend more time troubleshooting and fixing bugs than writing new code. Remember, seeking help is a crucial part of the development process.
